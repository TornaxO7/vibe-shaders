# vibe-shaders

A collection of shaders which you can mostly copy+paste from for [vibe](https://github.com/TornaxO7/vibe).

# Usage

Choose any `fragment.code` file and paste it into the config file of your output (in `~/.config/vibe-daemon/output_configs/<output-name>.toml`).
Note that the order _does_ matter since the renderer will render the fragment shaders from top to bottom which are listed in the file.
