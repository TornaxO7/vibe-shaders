# Structure

1. Create a directory with a name of your shader (should be nameful)
2. The directory must include a `README.md` with:

- enough information on what the shader produces (by using an image/video)
- don't forget to give credits (and ask for permission if needed) to the original creator if you are using it from somewhere else!
- templates are below

# Templates

```md
# Code

- `amount_bars = 60`

\`\`\`
[[shader_code]]
Glsl = """
<glsl code>
"""
\`\`\`
```

or

```md
# Code

- `amount_bars = 60`

\`\`\`
[[shader_code]]
Wgsl = """
<wgsl code>
\`\`\`
"""
```
